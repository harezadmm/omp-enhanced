# T1686: Disable or Modify System Firewall

**Matrix:** Enterprise | **Type:** Technique

## Description
Adversaries may disable or modify host-based or network firewalls to impair defensive mechanisms and enable further action. Once an adversary has gathered sufficient privileges, they can tamper with firewall services, policies, or rule sets to remove restrictions on inbound or outbound traffic. For example, this may include turning off firewall profiles, altering existing rules to permit previously blocked ports or protocols, or adding new rules that create covert communication paths (e.g., adding a new firewall rule for a well-known protocol (such as RDP) using a non-traditional and potentially less securitized port.(Citation: change_rdp_port_conti)
Adversaries may disable or modify firewalls using different behaviors, depending on the platform. For example, in ESXi, firewall rules may be modified directly via the esxcli (e.g., via esxcli network firewall set) or via the vCenter user interface.(Citation: Broadcom ESXi Firewall)(Citation: Trellix Rnasomhouse 2024)

## Mitigations
- **User Account Management** — User Account Management involves implementing and enforcing policies for the lifecycle of user accounts, including creation, modification, and deactivation. Proper account management reduces the attack surface by limiting unauthorized access, managing account privileges, and ensuring accounts are us
- **Restrict File and Directory Permissions** — Restricting file and directory permissions involves setting access controls at the file system level to limit which users, groups, or processes can read, write, or execute files. By configuring permissions appropriately, organizations can reduce the attack surface for adversaries seeking to access s
- **Restrict Registry Permissions** — Restricting registry permissions involves configuring access control settings for sensitive registry keys and hives to ensure that only authorized users or processes can make modifications. By limiting access, organizations can prevent unauthorized changes that adversaries might use for persistence,
- **Audit** — Auditing is the process of recording activity and systematically reviewing and analyzing the activity and system configurations. The primary purpose of auditing is to detect anomalies and identify potential threats or weaknesses in the environment. Proper auditing configurations can also help to mee
