# T1634: Credentials from Password Store

**Matrix:** Mobile | **Type:** Technique

## Description
Adversaries may search common password storage locations to obtain user credentials. Passwords can be stored in several places on a device, depending on the operating system or application holding the credentials. There are also specific applications that store passwords to make it easier for users to manage and maintain. Once credentials are obtained, they can be used to perform lateral movement and access restricted information.

## Tactics
Credential Access

## Platforms
iOS

## Procedure

## Mitigations
- **Security Updates** — Install security updates in response to discovered vulnerabilities.
- **Deploy Compromised Device Detection Method** — A variety of methods exist that can be used to enable enterprises to identify compromised (e.g. rooted/jailbroken) devices, whether using security mechanisms built directly into the device, third-party mobile security applications, enterprise mobility management (EMM)/mobile device management (MDM) 
- **Attestation** — Enable remote attestation capabilities when available (such as Android SafetyNet or Samsung Knox TIMA Attestation) and prohibit devices that fail the attestation from accessing enterprise resources.
